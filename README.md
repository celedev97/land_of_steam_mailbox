# Land Of Steam Mailbox
A simple plugin based on VORP for mailbox stuff, this plugin was originally an edit of vorp_mailbox, but the UI has been rewritten in angular and customized for the Land of Steam italian RP server, and there's a new bird post system that has been written by me, but using part of the spawn code by rsg-telegram for spawning the bird (I've remade the moving part because i prefer to have understanding and control over that kind of thing)


## Features
- choose from a list of players to sed a telegram
- prices for telegrams
- send broadcast messages for a price to everyone
- telegram can be delivered by bird post for fast delivery


## Installation
* `ensure land_of_steam_mailbox` in your resources called `Resources.cfg` 
* run the `SQL` provided for database

## License
This plugin comes from the combined work of [VORP_mailbox]([https://github.com/VORPCORE/vorp_mailbox) and [rsg-telegram](https://github.com/Rexshack-RedM/rsg-telegram), since GPL2 and GPL3 are incompatible i have no idea what is the correct license for this plugin so i left the original license from vorp_mailbox, if you have any complaint about the license feel free to contact me.
