# ***License*** 
This plugin comes from the combined work of (VORP_mailbox)[https://github.com/VORPCORE/vorp_mailbox] and [rsg-telegram](https://github.com/Rexshack-RedM/rsg-telegram), since GPL2 and GPL3 are incompatible i have no idea what is the correct license for this plugin so i left the original license from vorp_mailbox, if you have any complaint about the license feel free to contact me.
